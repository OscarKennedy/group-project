  TO DO
------------

Simulation design
 - include parameters relating to the mesa
 - ensure that mesa parameters are fed into the COMSOL model

COMSOL 
 - update model so that integration is performed over mesa only
    - (this should ensure that the FWHM is more meaningful as there will be spins only 
       in the mesa and thus the distribution will be narrower)

Post Processing
 - Characterize the FWHM of pi-pulses in some form of fitting routine
 
 Machine learning
  - Redo the machine learning on coupling strength relating to the mesa only!
  - Perform a pi-pulse fidelity machine learning run
